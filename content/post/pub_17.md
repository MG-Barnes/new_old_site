Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are soft phase-changing solids that exhibit large reversible contractions
upon heating, Goldstone-like soft modes, and resultant microstructural instabilities. We heat a planar LCE
slab to isotropic, clamp the lower surface, then cool back to nematic. Clamping prevents macroscopic
elongation, producing compression and microstructure. We see that the free surface destabilizes, adopting
topography with amplitude and wavelength similar to thickness. To understand the instability, we
numerically compute the microstructural relaxation of a “nonideal” LCE energy. Linear stability reveals a
Biot-like scale-free instability, but with oblique wave vector. However, simulation and experiment show
that, unlike classic elastic creasing, instability culminates in a crosshatch without cusps or hysteresis, and is
constructed entirely from low-stress soft modes.
